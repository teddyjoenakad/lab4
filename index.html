        <p>Sports have always been in my life. They help me relax in times of trouble and have become therapeutic
            to me. As a kid with lots of energy, I often played a lot of sports such as <em>basketball, soccer, track,
            and ping pong</em>. As my athletic abilities began to evolve throughout the years, I began to improve in sports
            like volleyball and rugby. Once I realized how much I enjoyed <strong>rugby and soccer</strong> I began
            to focus on those two sports and dedicated my time to them. I ended up being the <strong>captain</strong> 
            of both school teams and excelling in <strong>both</strong>. Now I play sports frequently throughout the week as it 
            helps me feel <em>relieved</em> and acts as a free therapy session.</p>
